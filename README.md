# League of Licenses

Third-party license acknowledgments is usually a text giving proper credit to the tools that were used to build the software. In our case that software is League of Legends.

This acknowledgement text eventually gets outdated due to updates to the used tools and their corresponding authors. This project attempts to help Riot Games keep that acknowledgment file updated.

Pull requests are welcome!
